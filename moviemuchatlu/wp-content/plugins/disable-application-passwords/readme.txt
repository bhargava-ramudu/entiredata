Activate this plugin to disable the Application Passwords feature that was added in WP v5.6.



== Description ==

> Does one thing: disables the "Application Passwords" feature.

Activate this plugin to completely disable the new Application Passwords functionality (added in WP version 5.6). To re-enable Application Passwords, simply deactivate the plugin.


**Features**

* Lightweight - only one line of code.
* Simple to use - activate and done.
* No settings to worry about.
* Easy peasy.


**Why is this useful?**

Because not every website is the same. Not every website needs this feature. Also disabling application passwords helps to limit unnecessary exposure and eliminate unwanted functionality (i.e., bloat). Whatever the reason, it is your choice. That's the beauty of WordPress. So if, for whatever reason, you decide that application passwords should be disabled, this plugin will do it with a click.
